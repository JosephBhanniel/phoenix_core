# PhoenixCore

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

## Add the following to your dev.exs file

Directory: /config/dev.exs

```elixir

import Config

# Configure your database
config :phoenix_core_bt, PhoenixCoreBt.Repo,
  username: "postgres",
  password: "postgres",
  hostname: "localhost",
  database: "phoenix_core_bt_dev",
  stacktrace: true,
  show_sensitive_data_on_connection_error: true,
  pool_size: 10

# For development, we disable any cache and enable
# debugging and code reloading.
#
# The watchers configuration can be used to run external
# watchers to your application. For example, we can use it
# to bundle .js and .css sources.
config :phoenix_core_bt, PhoenixCoreBtWeb.Endpoint,
  # Binding to loopback ipv4 address prevents access from other machines.
  # Change to `ip: {0, 0, 0, 0}` to allow access from other machines.
  http: [ip: {127, 0, 0, 1}, port: 4000],
  check_origin: false,
  code_reloader: true,
  debug_errors: true,
  secret_key_base: "3Goym3yNsHG3IeL/MkX2bn9n6g8W0UDZvfwfrNQBY6GzTq29S+HdjIwxe05203DJ",
  watchers: [
    esbuild: {Esbuild, :install_and_run, [:phoenix_core_bt, ~w(--sourcemap=inline --watch)]},
    tailwind: {Tailwind, :install_and_run, [:phoenix_core_bt, ~w(--watch)]}
  ]

# ## SSL Support
#
# In order to use HTTPS in development, a self-signed
# certificate can be generated by running the following
# Mix task:
#
#     mix phx.gen.cert
#
# Run `mix help phx.gen.cert` for more information.
#
# The `http:` config above can be replaced with:
#
#     https: [
#       port: 4001,
#       cipher_suite: :strong,
#       keyfile: "priv/cert/selfsigned_key.pem",
#       certfile: "priv/cert/selfsigned.pem"
#     ],
#
# If desired, both `http:` and `https:` keys can be
# configured to run both http and https servers on
# different ports.

# Watch static and templates for browser reloading.
config :phoenix_core_bt, PhoenixCoreBtWeb.Endpoint,

# in production as building large stacktraces may be expensive.

# Disable swoosh api client as it is only required for production adapters.
config :swoosh, :api_client, false
